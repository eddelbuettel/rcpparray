Description: Interoperability between 'Rcpp' and the 'C++11' array and tuple
    types. Linking to this package allows fixed-length 'std::array' objects to
    be converted to and from equivalent R vectors, and 'std::tuple' objects
    converted to lists, via the as() and wrap() functions. There is also
    experimental support for 'std::span' from 'C++20'.
